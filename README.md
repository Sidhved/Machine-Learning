1. Linear Regression
  1.1 Single Variabe Linear Regression:
  The file "SingleVariableLinearRegression.m" consists of the main driver code for the implementation of gradient descent and linear regression on the given data from file           "data1.txt".
The main file consists of the following processes:
1.1.1 Loading Data
1.1.2 Using the computeCost funtion to compute the cost J
1.1.3 Using the gradientDescent function to compute parameters theta
1.1.4 Plotting Linear Fit as seen below: ![Figure 1](https://github.com/Sidhved/Machine-Learning/blob/main/1.%20Linear%20Regression/Figure%201.PNG)
1.1.5 Visualising J(theta_0, theta_1) as a surface plot: ![Figure 2](https://github.com/Sidhved/Machine-Learning/blob/main/1.%20Linear%20Regression/Figure%202.PNG)
1.1.6 Visualising J(theta_0, theta_1) as a contour plot: ![Figure 3](https://github.com/Sidhved/Machine-Learning/blob/main/1.%20Linear%20Regression/Figure%203.PNG)
